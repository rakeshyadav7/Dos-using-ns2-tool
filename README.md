The project is to get understand the network topology and packet transferring between the servers/clients. In this project we also  perform a DOS attack using  Network Stimulator NS2.

# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to simulate and analyze the effects of a Denial-of-Service (DOS) attack on a network using the NS2 tool. The project involves installing NS2 on Ubuntu or any Linux operating system, creating a network topology using the Tcl language, and executing a DOS attack simulation. The simulation aims to emulate the impact of a DOS attack on network performance, network packet loss, and latency.
The main problem to address in this project is to design and implement an efficient simulation environment that accurately models a DOS attack and its consequences on a network. The simulation should replicate various types of DOS attacks, such as TCP SYN flood, ICMP flood, or UDP flood attacks, and measure their impact on network resources.
The project will require developing or utilizing existing NS2 scripts to configure the network topology, simulate the DOS attack, and record the output data obtained during the simulation. The output data will be stored in a file for subsequent analysis.
# How did you customize the project and make it your own:
1.By using parrot OS I performed this project
2.Installed NS2 and NAM.
3.Developed TCL files to understand about network topology.
4.Captured the packets  to understand how the devices communicate through internet.

# Introduction to Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:
1.Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the availability of a computer system, network, or service, making it inaccessible to its intended users.
2.These attacks overwhelm the target system with a flood of illegitimate traffic or by exploiting vulnerabilities to exhaust its resources, causing service disruptions and impacting productivity

# Setting up an NS2 simulation:
1 .To set up an NS2 simulation of a DOS attack, We will need to first download and install NS2 on your computer.
2.Once installed, we can begin creating your simulation by defining the network topology, configuring the nodes and links, and specifying the parameters for the attack. 
3.This can be done using NS2's built-in scripting language, which allows you to create custom scenarios and test different attack strategies.
